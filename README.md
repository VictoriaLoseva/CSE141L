# CSE141L
TODO: 
1. ALU unit test 

   a. See the synthesizable ALU.sv for an example
   
   b. ADD, AND, SETB, FLIP, SHL, BXOR - go in the first case(op) I believe

   c. XOR, GETBIT, RSET - in the second case(op) 

   d. modify testbench and definitions accordingly

2. Register file (not sure yet)

3. VLUT (values); ZERO, ONE, THIRTY, SIXTY

4. ALUT (addreses): TBD, probably changes with assembly & gotta load them in every time

5. Instruction memory / PC (not sure yet) 

6. Data Memory (lw / sw) (not sure yet)

7. Branches (not sure yet) 

8. Wiring

9. Once unit tests on processor elements are good, go to debugging assembler (for example, simple branches and trying to calculate P4) 

10. Debug P1 

11. Debug P2 

12. Debug P3 

13. Submit and celebrate!
